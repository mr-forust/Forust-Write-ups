Hi, I'm Forust, a fellow, who wants to be an ethical hacker.
This repo dedicated for my CTF and pentesting write-ups.
Currently *(2025-05-26 1:11â€¯AM)* I participated in only 2 CTF's:
	Nahamcon 2025 preCTF *(with almost no success)*
	Nahamcon 2025 CTF *(only one real task was solved)*
	XRock CTF (Fully completed, write-up in progress)
Also I solved some [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/MrForust) machines. I hope that ill write some write-ups about them someday.
