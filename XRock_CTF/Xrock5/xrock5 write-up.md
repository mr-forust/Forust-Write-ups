*chernuha, bro, where are the other 4??*

From the previous morse task, we have webpage with an SSH connect link
`ssh -p 2233 xrock5@qfxazzhumg.chernuha.xyz`
I run a rustscan on `qfxazzhumg.chernuha.xyz`, even if it's not necessary. I will not try to hack into the XRrock's infrasctructure, but u can try. 

*If you found a bug, please, contact with a developer via method, that provided in the XRock's telegram channel, or via `@MrForust` and `@chernuha_dev` telegram accounts (we are friendly. If you are speaking English - MrForust is the preferable option, but, anyway, message them all), or via email: `bobrovod@national.shitposting.agency`, but the response may take up a long time*
